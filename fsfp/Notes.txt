Notes for studying FSFP package:
0. Logged in my personal GitHub and pulled FSFP package to my iPEG folder
1. Installed necessary packages in cpeg-mlde env: torch, transformers, learn2learn
2. Try running "python retrieve.py -m vectorize -md esm2" to generate embeddings as instructed in the README.md file. Found a bug in pipeline.py file: 
File retrival.py imports "model_names" from pipeline.py but there was nothing to import. Added a line that imports model_names from config.json (current line17)
3. Try running "python retrieve.py -m vectorize -md esm2" again. It ran successfully but did not output anything. 
Realize that it processes test dataset in data/substititions folder and save the results into retrived folder with file name "vectors_esm2.pkl"
4. Try opening the pkl file as instructed by ChatGPT using pickle but couldn't. Try opening merged.pkl in data folder (part of the processing) but still couldn't 
5. Digged preprocess.py and data.py (under utils) and realized that the pkl files were saved with torch.save(). 
Tried using torch.load() to open the above files and finally succeeded. 
6. Tried some other functions in data.py to understand what does "preprocessing" do. 
Realized that the input csv files had quite a lot of columns of which i dont understand the meaning. These are dms datasets, but with some other labels too. 
7. To find out: how many inputs there are in these two test csv? 
Where do they come from and what are the meanings of the labels? 
Why does the package want to merge them? More importantly, how were the embedding vectors generated (in retrival.py)?
